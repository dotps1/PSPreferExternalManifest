This is to just help with that.\r\n\r\n###Examples###\r\n\r\nThis will verify the registry key exists, if not create it, test for the manifest file, in not found, creates it.\r\nOnly adds the dpiAware value.\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> Set-ApplicationManifestNotDpiAware -Path 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\KeePass Password Safe 2\\KeePass.exe'\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\KeePass Password Safe 2\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a----         3/9/2016   9:30 AM           1294 KeePass.exe.manifest\r\nWARNING: The manifest was created successfuly for C:\\Program Files (x86)\\KeePass Password Safe 2\\KeePass.exe.
